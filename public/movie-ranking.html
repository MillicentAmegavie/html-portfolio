<h3>3. Shogun</h3>
<p>
Shogun follows the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds, John Blackthorne, a risktaking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him, and Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful damiyo, at odds with his own dangerous political rivals. The storyline also includes Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance.
